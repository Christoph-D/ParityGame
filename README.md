# Parity Games

Formal proofs about parity games in the generic proof assistant
[Isabelle](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

This is the official development repository of
<https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Parity_Game.shtml>.

The `afp` branch contains the AFP version, which should be identical
to <https://foss.heptapod.net/isa-afp/afp-devel/>.  The `master`
branch is the development branch.
